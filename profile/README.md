 RISCV Vela
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the RISC-V Based Software-Defined Robotics project. This repository serves as a central hub for system software development to support robotics applications built on the RISC-V architecture.

## Overview
This repository focuses on expanding the Software-Defined Robotics (SDR) ecosystem using RISC-V hardware extension technologies and system software. The project name, Vela, means "sail" in Latin, symbolizing a starting point for applying RISC-V technology in the SDR field.

## Requirement List
This repository includes tools for the development environment, Linux kernel, middleware, and the Robot Operating System (ROS2). To meet the demands of SDR applications, the following features are added to existing open-source capabilities:
1. Low Power Consumption: Enabling robots to operate for extended periods on a single charge.
2. High Efficiency: Optimizing performance for image recognition and AI processing under constrained space and power conditions.
3. High Reliability: Ensuring stability and trustworthiness of ROS2-based robots through process isolation between ROS2 applications.
4. High Availability: Managing and controlling hardware and software faults within robotic systems.
5. Message Delivery Optimization: Enhancing inter-application message delivery performance in ROS2.
