## 1. Project Name and Meaning

Project Name: Vela

Meaning:

“Vela” is derived from a constellation name, meaning “the sail that opens a voyage.” This project symbolizes opening a new voyage for Software-Defined
Robotics (SDR) through open RISC-V–based system software technologies.

## 2. Project Purpose
This project aims to establish an open ecosystem for intelligent service robots (SDR: Software-Defined Robotics) by developing open RISC-V–based system software technologies that are royalty-free and independent from foreign, closed computing platforms.
Currently, most robot platforms depend on closed systems based on ARM or x86 architectures, which limit hardware flexibility and impose high licensing costs and vendor lock-in issues. These limitations hinder technological innovation, scalability,and autonomous development.
This research seeks to create an open RISC-V–based SDR computing platform that enables flexible hardware configurations and optimization, reducing reliance on foreign technologies.
RISC-V is an open instruction set architecture (ISA) that allows anyone to extend, customize, and implement it without royalties. Based on this RISC-V architecture,the project focuses on developing the following core system software technologies:
 - Low Power: Maximize energy efficiency through power management and thermal control
 - High Performance: Integrate multiple AI execution engines and apply multimodel scheduling for performance optimization
 - High Reliability: Support a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for confidential computing
 - High Availability: Implement RAS (Error-record Register Interface) for system error prediction, recovery, and continuous operation
   
By integrating these technologies, the project will build a RISC-V Linux kernel–based system software distribution, incorporating AI execution engines, ROS2 (DDS)-based middleware, compilers, profilers, and verification emulators to create an open software platform for intelligent robotics.
Ultimately, the goal is to strengthen the domestic RISC-V system software ecosystem, enhance competitiveness in various SDx (On-Device AI) industries, and promote both technological self-reliance and global open-source collaboration.

## 3. License
The Vela project is an open RISC-V–based SDR system software stack that includes multiple open-source components such as the Linux kernel, ROS2, and Ubuntu packages. Therefore, it is distributed under a multi-license open-source scheme, where each component retains its original license.
 - Linux Kernel: GPL-2.0 only
 - ROS2: Apache-2.0 / BSD-3-Clause
 - Ubuntu Packages: GPL, LGPL, MIT, BSD, and other upstream licenses
